Utilizes acoustic sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect and analyze audio signals for gunshot sounds.
Sends real-time alerts to the designated authorities, enabling swift response to potential threats.
### Forest Smoke Detection:

Employs advanced image recognition algorithms to analyze visual data from cameras placed strategically in the forest.
Identifies and classifies smoke patterns, promptly alerting authorities to potential wildfires.
### Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:

Provides a user-friendly dashboard for real-time monitoring of the forest.
Displays live data on gunshot events and smoke occurrences, enabling quick decision-making.
### Geolocation and Mapping:

Integrates GPS technology to pinpoint the exact location of detected events.
Generates maps for better visualization of events and facilitates quick response coordination.
### Historical Data Analysis:

Stores and analyzes historical data to identify patterns and improve overall forest management strategies.
Enables authorities to assess the frequency and intensity of past incidents for better planning.
### Scalability and Customization:

Designed to be scalable to accommodate various forest sizes and topographies.
Allows customization based on specific forest management needs and requirements.
